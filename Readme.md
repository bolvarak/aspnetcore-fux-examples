# `Fux` Examples Application

Keep an eye on this repository as it will be updated regularly as the
libraries are fleshed out to reflect all the new and exciting things
that have been added, changed and completely broken :speak_no_evil::hear_no_evil::see_no_evil:

For those of you looking at this document from [NuGet.org](https://nuget.org/)
rock on over to the [Github Repo](https://github.com/bolvarak/aspnetcore-fux-examples)
and take a look at the goodies there.

Happy coding home skillets :metal::metal:

## What the fux?!
We all know what it sounds like and in reality, it is.  However, being
the intellectual that I am, I like to think of `Fux` being the happy
median between fixed and absolutely fucked.

That's really how this library works.  Some things are [or will be] 
pretty awesome.  Then, other things will be absolutely terrible, broken
and just all around shite.  It's as if ADHD learned how to code and
decided to write a library :joy::joy:
